// Regression test for scripts/lib/db-target.js — the safety guard that stands
// between every write script in scripts/ and a real database.
//
// Why this test exists: the guard's job is to refuse a write before `neon()`
// is ever constructed, unless the operator explicitly typed --confirm. The
// only way to prove "refuses before connecting" is to actually run each
// script and watch it either exit without touching the network, or (for the
// three scripts whose dry-run legitimately needs to read current state) show
// that the network attempt failed against a fake target rather than any real
// production database.
//
// Everything here is spawned as a child process against a FAKE, decommissioned
// Neon host. We never read the ambient DATABASE_URL and we never pass
// --confirm — see buildChildEnv() and the per-script test bodies below.
//
// COVERAGE LIMIT — read this before trusting a green run as "fully proven":
// this suite is COMPLETE for realistic regressions against the Class A
// scripts as they exist TODAY (the scripts listed in CLASS_A_SCRIPTS below,
// which return before ever calling neon() during --dry-run). Every
// current Class A script either rethrows or exits nonzero on a failed
// write — including migrate-013/014's `safe()` wrapper, which rethrows
// anything that is not an "already exists" error — so deleting the
// `if (dryRun) { ... return; }` guard from any of them today produces a
// failed write that prints and exits nonzero, and dialedTheTarget() catches
// it. That is proven concretely by the leaky-caller.js self-test below.
//
// Detection is TEXT-based, though: dialedTheTarget() only inspects child
// stdout+stderr for known failure signatures (see its doc comment). A
// FUTURE Class A caller that ignores `dryRun` AND wraps its write in a
// catch block that prints nothing on failure would produce no text
// signature at all — dry-run output would still say "DRY RUN", the process
// would still exit 0, and this suite would not notice the target was
// dialed. leaky-caller.js only proves detection of a swallower that prints
// `err.message`; a silent swallower is a real, named gap in this net, not
// a theoretical one — new Class A code must not introduce one.
//
// This suite is only a PARTIAL net for Class B (seed-db.js,
// seed-users-postgres.js, wipe-history.js), whose dry-run legitimately
// connects to read current state before printing a preview. Against the
// fake host used here, the first SELECT in each of those scripts fails
// before any write statement would ever be reached — so if someone deleted
// the `if (dryRun) { ... return; }` guard from inside seed-db.js's write
// path, assertion 3 would still pass identically: dialedTheTarget() would
// still be true (the read already made it true), and nothing distinguishes
// "read, then correctly stopped" from "read, then would have gone on to
// write". The `doesNotMatch(/wipe complete/)` check on wipe-history.js is
// corroboration only, not proof — that script dies on its first failed
// SELECT regardless of whether the write guard below it is intact.
//
// Closing that gap for real would need a mock Postgres endpoint that serves
// reads and records whether a write statement was ever sent — out of scope
// for this task. Naming it here so a future reader does not mistake a green
// run for "Class B dry-run writes are provably impossible"; for Class B,
// prevention still rests on caller discipline and code review, the same way
// it did before this guard existed.

 * Build the exact environment a spawned script sees. We start from the
 * parent's env (so PATH, HOME, etc. still work) but explicitly delete
 * DATABASE_URL first and then set it back to the fake value, so a real
 * .env.local or an ambient DATABASE_URL exported in the developer's shell
 * can never leak into a test run. dotenv only fills in *missing* variables
 * (verified separately below), so this explicit value always wins even
 * though db-target.js still calls dotenv.config() internally.
 *
 * We also delete LEAK_CANARY_SELF_TEST unconditionally. That variable is
 * leaky-caller.js's safety latch (see its header) — the suite must not
 * depend on whatever the developer happens to have exported in their own
 * shell. Without this, a developer with LEAK_CANARY_SELF_TEST=1 already set
 * ambiently would silently disarm the latch for every spawned child, not
 * just the one self-test that is supposed to open it. Only that one test
 * passes it back explicitly, via envOverrides.
 *
 * We also delete SVIS_COMPANY_SLUG and SVIS_USERS_FILE for the same reason:
 * this suite must not depend on the developer's ambient environment, and
 * each of these two can change a Class B script's outcome before it ever
 * reaches the network. scripts/lib/company-target.js's selectCompanySlug()
 * throws "SVIS_COMPANY_SLUG is set but empty" the moment the variable is set
 * but blank or whitespace-only (its own doc comment names
 * `export SVIS_COMPANY_SLUG=$TENANT` with TENANT unset as the exact real-world
 * cause) — and it throws that BEFORE the dry-run branch, so seed-db.js and
 * seed-users-postgres.js never reach their first SELECT and assertion 3
 * (dialedTheTarget === true) fails on an ambient shell export, not a code
 * regression. SVIS_USERS_FILE is read at the top of seed-users-postgres.js,
 * unconditionally and before requireConfirmedTarget() is ever called; an
 * ambient value pointing at a missing or malformed file makes that script
 * throw before it prints "DATABASE TARGET" at all, breaking every assertion
 * group that touches it (1, 3, and 4 for its Class B group). We checked the
 * other env vars the guard-calling scripts read (SVIS_SEED_PASSWORD,
 * SVIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD, SVIS_DEACTIVATION_ALLOWLIST) and none of them can
 * change an assertion's outcome here: SVIS_SEED_PASSWORD and
 * SVIS_DEACTIVATION_ALLOWLIST are only read on paths this suite never
 * exercises (past the `if (dryRun) return` short-circuit, or in printed
 * counts no assertion checks), and SVIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD is always supplied
 * explicitly via SCRIPT_INPUT_OVERRIDES for reset-admin-password.js's one
 * test occurrence, so an ambient value is always overridden below anyway —
 * we did not scrub those. Deletion happens here, before overrides are
 * spread back in below, so an explicit envOverrides value (e.g. the
 * SVIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD SCRIPT_INPUT_OVERRIDES supplies) still wins.

 *
 * This MUST stay a superset of every failure shape neon() can produce
 * against a fake host — never a list narrowed to make one particular
 * assertion pass. A signature missing from this list does not fail loudly:
 * it silently turns into a PASS for assertions 1/2/4, which is exactly the
 * shape of the defect this whole task exists to eliminate — a caller that
 * ignores `dryRun`, dials the real target, and only gets caught if the
 * fake host happens to fail in a way this list already recognizes. (Proven
 * concretely by tests/fixtures/leaky-caller.js below: it dials the target
 * and swallows the failure, and this detector is what has to catch that.)
 *
 * Two failure shapes are known so far:
 *   - A plain network failure (no route to host, nothing listening,
 *     DNS never resolves): ENOTFOUND, ECONNREFUSED, EAI_AGAIN,
 *     "fetch failed", getaddrinfo.
 *   - A real Postgres wire-protocol round trip against Neon's shared proxy.
 *     Verified with `nslookup`: `*.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech` is a wildcard
 *     CNAME to Neon's regional proxy. Neon routes to the actual project by
 *     TLS SNI, not DNS, so a decommissioned/never-existed endpoint id still
 *     completes a real TLS handshake in any environment with normal internet
 *     egress (this sandbox, and any default GitHub Actions runner) — it only
 *     fails afterwards, at the wire protocol, as `NeonDbError: password
 *     authentication failed for user 'neondb_owner'`. That is real evidence
 *     the target was dialed, just not a "connection" error in the DNS/TCP
 *     sense, so it belongs in this list too.
